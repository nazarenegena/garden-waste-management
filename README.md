# Garden Waste Management

Garden Waste Management is a page redesign of the **Skip Selection** page from [We Want Waste](https://wewantwaste.co.uk/)

This is a Coding Challenge.

## Objective

- **Maintaining the existing functional integrity.**
- **Improving the overall look, feel and hierarchy.**
- **Enhancing usability and accessibility across devices.**

## Tech Stack

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** – A lightning-fast development and build tool.
- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** – Component-based UI framework.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** – Static type-checking for scalable code.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – Utility-first styling for responsive design.

## Features

- A responsive redesign optimized for both **mobile** and **desktop** across devices
- Clean and maintainable React code
- Enhanced user experience with improved layout and visual hierarchy.

## My Approach

**Component Architecture & Code Structure**

Destructured the page into reusable React components.

Created types to ensure scalable, type-safe development.

Clear file and folder structures for better maintainability.

**Visual Redesign**

Added Dark and Light mode for different screen views and eye comfort.

Applied consistent spacing-padding, and added visual hierarchy.

Enhanced the typography and color contrast for readability and clarity.

In-cooperated hover, focus, and active states for interactive elements.

Added visual cues such as checked in card selection to improve flow clarity.

**Responsive Mobile-First Design**

Integrated Tailwind’s responsive utilities to ensure layout adjusts fluidly across breakpoints.

Prioritized mobile usability by reducing padding and margin clutter on small screens.

**Data Integration**

Fetched skip data from the provided API endpoint and rendered dynamically.

Handled loading states and errors to ensure a smooth UX.

**Accessibility Considerations**

Applied color contrast between elements.

# Summary

This project has been a fun practical challenge. I have greatly enjoyed working on it.
It has pushed me to balance UI/UX improvements while maintaining core functionality.
